		<h3>Melissa Gymrek</h3>
		<h4>Principal Investigator</h4>
		Melissa is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Medicine at the University of California San Diego. Previously, she was a post-doctoral researcher with Mark Daly and received my PhD in 2016 in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics from the Harvard/MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology under the supervision of Yaniv Erlich and Mark Daly. Her major research interest is to understand complex genetic variants that underlie phenotypic changes, ultimately leading to human disease. When she's not in the lab, Melissa enjoys trail running, hiking, and hanging out with her family.
