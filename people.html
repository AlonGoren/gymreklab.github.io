		<h3>Stephanie F. </h3>
		<h4>PhD student (Bafna Lab)</h4>
		Stephanie is PhD student in Bioinformatics and system Biology, under the Biomedical informatics track at UC San Diego. At the intersection of personal genomics and personalized medicine, Stephanieâ€™s research interest concentrates on understanding the impact of genetic variations on phenotype. Her current research investigates the influence of Short Tandem Repeats on gene expression, as well as in the context of other variants. Stephanie is also interested in phenotype standardization for Biomedical research.
